Requirements
=======

Gaveldor 2 requires Java Version 1.6 or higher, and a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768.


Running The Game
========
Run the following command line in the project folder:

java -jar gaveldor2.jar


Some errors may appear in the terminal window, but the game will operate normally.  These
just have to deal with black and white PNGs.


Known Bugs
========
The following are known bugs with Gaveldor 2:
    1) On the instructions page in a widescreen view and fullscreen mode, sometimes the
        images stretch awkwardly.
    2) It is possible to crash Java if you click during a blank loading screen. This is
        a JVM problem.  (This tends to happen more on Windows than Mac.)
