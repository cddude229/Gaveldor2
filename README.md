Known Bugs
========
The following are known bugs with Gaveldor 2:
    1) On the instructions page in a widescreen view and fullscreen mode, sometimes the
        images stretch awkwardly.
    2) It is possible to crash Java if you click during a blank loading screen. This is
        a JVM problem.  (This tends to happen more on Windows than Mac.)
